# Read: 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- More than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.
- Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.
- Understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.
- What distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.
  - The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
- First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
  - But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.
- Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
- Psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work
- To be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations.
  - We want to know that work is more than just labor.
- Figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.

## The above notes were lines within the article I thought were keys points and gave me a better understanding on how to handle and excell in working with groups. THESE ARE NOT MY OWN WORDS!
